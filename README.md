ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone, Iâ€™m Hugh! Just a junior web developer who likes to help others. 

I've been fortunate enough to learn from amazing people and thought that it was about time to start building something for myself.

I'm trying to be consistent and contribute code on Github not only to improve my fundamentals but also showcase my projects. 

By no means am I an expert but I'm always keen to learn and explore new things!
